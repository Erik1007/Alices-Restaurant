## Introduction
********************


This website introduces the user/world to a fictional restuarant (inspired by Arlo Guthrie) that is set in the luxurious inner downtown harbour archipelego in Stockholm Sweden. Using real landmarks for inspiration with a twist of fiction, this website aims to provide the user with something fun and functional.

This project is designed to represent an imaginary restuarant (semi-set in Stockholm Sweden) that is designed to be interactive and informative. The goal of the project is to combine django foundations and bootsrap elements that facilitate a working database on the back end of the project that a user can interact with using every element of the C.R.U.D. model. 





## Program Features
********************

This app is set up to mimic a real world website for a restuarant, therefor it has a number of essentail features for any real world business. From the fully functional navigation bar to the informative footer, the central features of the website are the reservaation system and the review section which are both interactive and function with the users input. The reservation system is an open system that anyone can interact with the website to make a reservation; however, to be able to leave a review or comment, one has to signup to be a member of the restuarant. As this website is designed with bootstrap it is a moblie first design and there for is fully responsive, thereby meeting the needs to be informative and look good on multiple screen sizes.

The main page is designed to entice the user to click further and explore the website.
This main page uses a looping background video that shows many highlights of the restuarant, from the food, to people enjoying themselves at the establishment, with some inspirational cameos too.

On the main page, just below the main background video, there is a link that whisks the user to the booking system,for those that instantly want to come join us for a good time, so that they can start interacting with the website and entering information.

On the top of the main page there is a navigation bar that allows the user to easily move from page to page of the restuarant to fully explore and become inticed by the restaurant. This navigation bar is preseant on every page, along with the footer for easy navigation through the webite. Links to the signup page, the food and drink menu's, the page telling a bit of a fictional backstory and of course to the reservation system are all preseant.

At the bottom of the main page the footer can be found. In the footer section alot of vital business inforation can be found. On the left hand side there is a column providing the important business information for the address location, phone number and the website, along with a link to google maps that provides an interactive geo-location for the restuarant.
In the middle section of the footer, the user can find interactive shortcut links that help to navigate around the webiste. On the right hand side of the footer, the last of the vital information is found concerning the open hours.

From the navigation bar, the signup page is fairly straightforward, proding interactive prompts for the user to create a log in username and password to be a memeber of the restuarant. The seond link from the navigation bar is for member to log in so that they can leave a review or comment on the review page. The next link in the navigation bar brings the user to the food menu so that the user can see descriptions of the mouth watering food selection. The foloowing link on the navigation bar brings the user to the nect main reason to visit the restuarant, its incredible and vast selction of drinks which are fully described in the drink menu. From there the navigation bar provides the user to see other customers thoughts/opinions of the resturant and dining expericnce on the review page. And finally the navigation bar provides the customer the link to the reservation system so that they can make their booking.







## Future Implementaions
********************

In the future, there are a few additonal interactive steps that I would like to add that would increase the satisfaction feelings of using this site:

The first and formost addional step that I would like to make would be to make both the restuarant and the bar menus fully interactive when each item was hovered over a widget image would pop up on the side of the page displaying the item in all its glory in an attempy to inspire the users appetite desires.

Secondly, I would like to include more background images and videos for every template page that would increa the viewing pleasure for the user and hopefully increase the visitor traffic to the imaginary restuarant.




## Testing and Validation

## Deployment
********************


There are multiple provides supporting the deployment of this project. The code was written and stored in the[Alices Restuarant GitHub repository](https://github.com/Erik1007/Alices-Restaurant). This was migrated to [Heroku Alices Restuarant](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/alices-restaurant-eh) to deploy the inbedded Django and python code. [ElephantSQL](https://api.elephantsql.com) was linked into to house the databases used for this project. And lastly, [Cloudinary](https://console.cloudinary.com) was linked in and used as the media storage.
