                    <p class="">The Home of Alice's Restaurant, with its simple and clean design
                        language, has been a landmark in Stockholm since 1955. It was designed by the
                        well-known architect Peter Celsing back in 1949 and was the first architect-designed pier side
                        gas station in Sweden. With its humble and yet sleek design, this building has been
                        the centerpiece of the inner harbor for over 70 years.</p>

                        After a number of different businesses, such as
                        tourist office, ice cream bar, cafe and pizzeria, the time finally came to transform the
                        iconic structure into a pure restaurant and brasserie with bars and outdoor seating. The future looks as
                        bright as a glass of champagne overlooking the calm harbor</p>
